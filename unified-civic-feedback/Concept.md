# Unified Civic Feedback Interface (UCFFI) - Lean Canvas

---

## Problem

* Citizens juggle multiple portals (websites, helplines, paper forms).
* Requests get lost, duplicated, or delayed.
* Agencies lack transparency into their backlogs and SLAs.

---

## Customer Segments

* Urban & rural citizens needing municipal services (repair potholes, waste collection).
* Municipal governments / city corporations / local bodies.
* Civic-tech NGOs & community groups.

---

## Unique Value Proposition

**“One-stop, geo-tagged service portal that connects citizens with municipal agencies—fast, transparent, and accountable.”**

---

## Solution

* Geo-tagged issue logging (photos, categories, priority).
* Department router and SLA-based workflows.
* Multi-channel status notifications (SMS, WhatsApp, email).
* Public dashboard with KPIs (resolution time, satisfaction).

---

## Channels

* Embedded widget on municipal websites.
* Progressive Web App / Mobile app.
* SMS / WhatsApp bots.

---

## Revenue Streams

* SaaS subscriptions by municipalities.
* Transaction-based fees (per request over free tier).
* Grants / CSR funding for civic-tech initiatives.

---

## Cost Structure

* Development & DevOps (hosting, monitoring).
* Customer support & onboarding.
* Marketing & partnership outreach.

---

## Key Metrics

* # Requests filed per month.
* Average resolution time.
* Citizen satisfaction score (NPS).
* Active municipal customers.

---

## Unfair Advantage

* Pre-built integrations with geocoding, SMS/WhatsApp APIs.
* Open311 compatibility and municipal open-data alignment.

## 2. Implementation Approach

To rapidly build and demonstrate the UCFFI Proof of Concept (POC), we recommend using **Golang for the backend** and serving a simple **JavaScript-powered UI** from the same application. This approach enables a single codebase, easy local hosting, and minimal infrastructure overhead, accelerating development and deployment of the initial prototype.

### Technology Stack

* **Backend:**
    * **Golang (Go)**: Chosen for its performance, concurrency, and ease of deployment.
    * **Gin framework**: A high-performance HTTP web framework in Go, ideal for building REST APIs and handling routing efficiently.

* **Templates & Static Assets:**
    * **Go’s `html/template` package**: For server-side rendering of initial HTML pages, providing a robust way to inject dynamic data.
    * Serving static JS/CSS: Go's built-in capabilities will be used to serve static JavaScript and CSS files, simplifying asset management.

* **JavaScript:**
    * **Vanilla JS (or lightweight framework like Alpine.js)**: To handle client-side interactivity such as form submissions, dynamic map interactions, and real-time status updates within the browser without heavy frontend frameworks.

* **Geocoding & Mapping:**
    * **Public map embed (e.g., Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap)**: For interactive mapping functionalities, allowing users to pinpoint issue locations.
    * **Geocoding API (e.g., Google Geocoding or Nominatim)**: To convert addresses or place names into geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) and vice-versa, enhancing the geo-tagging feature.
